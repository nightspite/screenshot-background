## Motivation

After using [Cleanshot X](https://cleanshot.com/) for a while, the simple screenshots aren't doing it for me anymore. Unfortunately, Cleanshot is only available on macos, so I created a small reproduction of their background feature.

## Features

- [x] ...

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies

# Run the app
yarn dev

# Build the app

- [ ] bg blur
- [ ] bg opacity
- [ ] screenshot alignment
